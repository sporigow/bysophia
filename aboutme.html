                <br>I am currently a Junior at the Stamps School of Art and Design at the University of Michigan majoring in Art & Design(BFA). I have been doing art since I was 3 (back then it was mostly abstract) and I am currently an aspiring artist and designer. I didn't have any background in digital art or design going into college but I am now quite proficient in design and Adobe products.
                <br><br>I also tried a coding class on a whim and ended up really enjoying it—I found it required the same creativity skills I use in art! Hence, I am minoring in User Experience Design through the School of Information at U of M. I recently completed a web development course and now proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and accessible web design. I also have experience in C++ and Python.
                <br> <br>
                
                In my free time (besides doing art) I enjoy talking to my dog, eating pickles, and researching things that have no relevance to my life in any way.
